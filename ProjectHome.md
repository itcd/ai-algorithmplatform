AI Algorithm Platform -- a series of AI agorithms, including convex hull, nearest neighbor, pathfinding and concollision detection. (Written in C#)

We both develop some classic algorithms, and some new algorithms based on our M2M Model, which is an new approach to implement these algorithms efficiently.
