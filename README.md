AI Algorithm Platform -- a series of AI agorithms, including convex hull, nearest neighbor, pathfinding and concollision detection. (Written in C#)

We both develop some classic algorithms, and some new algorithms based on our M2M Model, which is an new approach to implement these algorithms efficiently.

For more details, please refer to our papers: 

The M2M Pathfinding Algorithm Based on the Idea of Granular Computing
