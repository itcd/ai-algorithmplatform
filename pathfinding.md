<blockquote>The M2M Pathfinding Algorithm</p>
<p>
Macro-to-micro (M2M) model is an implementation model that inherits the GrC idea<br>
and extends it to some additional highly desirable characteristics. In this<br>
paper we introduce an effective pathfinding algorithm based on the M2M model.<br>
This algorithm takes O(n) time to preprocess, constructing the M2M data<br>
structure. Such hierarchical structure occupies O(n) bit memory space and can be<br>
updated in O(1) expected time to handle changes. Although the resulting path is<br>
not always the shortest one, it can make a trade-off between accuracy and time<br>
cost by adjusting a parameter - range value to satisfy various applications. At<br>
last, we will discuss the advantages of the M2M pathfinding algorithm (M2M-PF)<br>
and demonstrate the academic and applied prospect of M2M model.</p>
